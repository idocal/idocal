The website works on literally every platform: smartphones, tablets and desktops. There is no installation or sign up required and a chat pops up about 10 seconds after visiting the site for the first time. Three gamification tweaks were introduced - funny random name generator, political figure avatar icon and a timer for each conversation. The gamified user experience made users feel that the website is a safe space for an open conversation and removes the walls of the common toxic political discourse online.'
